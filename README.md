# Heart-disease-Detector
The heart disease detector project is a machine learning-based system that analyzes patient data to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The system takes in patient information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other medical factors as input and analyzes this data using various machine learning algorithms to determine the likelihood of heart disease.  The project typically involves the following steps: 

## Data Collection
The first step is to collect patient data from various sources, such as electronic medical records, clinical trials, or surveys.

## Data Preprocessing
The collected data is then preprocessed to remove any irrelevant or incomplete information and to normalize the data to ensure consistency.

## Feature Extraction
The next step is to extract relevant features from the preprocessed data, which will be used as input to the machine learning algorithms. 

## Model Training
Once the features are extracted, the machine learning algorithms are trained on the dataset using various techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. 

## Model Evaluation
The trained models are then evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess their effectiveness in predicting heart disease.
